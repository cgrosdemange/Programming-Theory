# GOAL
A project demonstrating :
- Abstraction: reducing duplicate code by “abstracting out” repeated details or information.
- Encapsulation: “encapsulating” data and the methods that manipulate that data together in a class, protecting it from misuse by other classes.
- Inheritance: child classes deriving (or “inheriting”) behavior from parent classes.
- Polymorphism: changing (“morphing”) methods into many (“poly”) forms (i.e., method overloading and method overriding).

# My Project
This is a mini racing game.
You drive a Vehicle and collect gasoline to finish the race.
After 5 races won, you unlock a sport car which can use nitro boost.
